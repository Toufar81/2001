ðŸŽ² Dice Game - Flask Application

ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project is a web application built with Flask that simulates a dice game between a player and the computer. The player can choose names, roll the dice, and compete against the computer based on a predefined winning score.

ðŸ”§ Installation

Install Python (version 3.8 or later)

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows

Install required packages:

pip install flask

ðŸš€ Running the Application

python app.py

Open a browser and go to:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/

ðŸŽ® Game Mechanics

The player enters their name and the opponent's name.

Each player starts with 0 points.

In their turn, a player rolls 2 dice (standard D6 dice).

The number of obtained pips is added to the total score.

Starting from the second turn:
    if a player rolls a 7, they divide their number of points by 7, disregarding the fractional part,
    if the player rolls an 11, they multiply the current number of points by 11.

The player who first reaches 2001 points wins.
